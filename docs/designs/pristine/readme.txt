Please feel free to use and modify this tempalte for use on your site.  I dont mind
if you use it for your personal site or a commercial site, but I do insist that it is
not sold or given away in some "50,000 Templates!" package or something like that
without first contacting me (via my site) and discussing the issue.

Thanks!  If you are using my template I'd love to hear about it!  Drop by my site
and let me know!
